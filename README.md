1] This project involved creating an Android Application, for assisting students to find or create student study groups.

2] This project highly focused on the ease of usability of the application, and the efficiency and effectiveness of the interaction with the user.

3] We have incorporated several Android features into the application, to make the application as understandable and as appealing to the users as possible.

Some of the features were as follows:

1] Students could find and join existing study groups (Regular/Adhoc), or create new study groups for a specific course.

2] They could the list of courses they are enrolled in, and view all the existing groups for a given course. 

3] They could view and delete notifications from a particular study group that they have joined, and leave the group if need be.
